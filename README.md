# smt-zvs-driver

My main design goal was a handheld battery operated induction coil. This design is for short duty cycle use ( 10 - 15 seconds)  such as loosening rusted nuts, heat treating small tool bits, brazing, soldering, or my favorite, heating a titanium nail.
I used a popular ZVS circuit from this forum: http://4hv.org/e107_plugins/forum/forum_viewtopic.php?122354  Thanks Marko!

This fits on a 2" diameter circular board glued to a 1" thick aluminum disc heatsink with Arctic Cooling's thermal epoxy. The driver connects to a tank circuit made up of 6uf - 10uf CD capacitors and a 4 turn 1/2" diameter work coil via (2) 1/4" brass busbars. I used (4) A123 LiFePo batteries for power as they have a very high discharge current rating and are currently the safest lithium battery tech available.

I bored out (paper thin in some areas, lol) a Sky Ray King flashlight and managed to cram everything in using 4 18650 size batteries. This will heat a Highly Educated Flux Titanium style nail to cherry red in about 10 seconds. Using the larger 26650 cells the heat time reduces to less than half at the expense of extra bulk.
